Customer Complaints Analysis for Top 5 Banks

Overview

This Business Analytics project examines consumer complaints data for the top 5 banks from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The goal was to derive insights on complaint patterns and develop a predictive model to help banks preemptively address potential disputes, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.

Objectives

Analyze complaint submission methods and resolution outcomes.
Predict dispute likelihood to improve initial complaint handling.
Recommend strategies for reducing future complaints and associated costs.
Methodology

Data Cleaning: Prepared the dataset for analysis, addressing missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized complaint trends and identified key factors associated with disputes.
Predictive Analytics: Used Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to predict the likelihood of a complaint being disputed.
Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn)
SVM for predictive modeling
Tableau for data visualization
Results

Identified key complaint types and their resolution rates.
Developed a model with 66% accuracy in predicting complaint disputes.
Recommended targeted interventions for banks to reduce dispute rates and operational costs.
Team Contributions

Data Scientists: Led the analytical and predictive modeling efforts.
Business Analysts: Provided insights into the banking industry and complaint management practices.
Visualization Experts: Created interactive dashboards to communicate findings effectively.
